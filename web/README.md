# web_projects
Some tiny web projects made for technical test or school projects

## PHP
### camagru
school project made in raw php. It took me 1 month of work (and learning/testing/failing/retrying/…)

### Matters (technical test)
this is a technical test made in 4h a sunday afternoon… made in symfony 4, it is just an api

### ritrit (technical test)
this is a simple page made in php/slim3 + twig + w3css (same as matcha, one of my other webite) during a technical test for a start-up. It was a try to show that i can understand and create their MVP.

## ruby

this is a tiny blog made in ruby/sinatra during a technical test for a start-up. I had 24h to do that starting from scratch (i'm not a ruby dev ^^).
